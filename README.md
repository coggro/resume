##### _October 2021 to Present_

- Maintain multiple projects in AEM and Angular and develop new components for key initiatives, including a Sustainer Lightbox to help convert one time donations to sustaining monthly donations and implementing an employer matching widget that brought in upwards of $90k of revenue in 2 weeks.
- Lead Web Performance meetings to monitor SEO and performance optimization.

- Work towards and complete annual goals for certification and continuing education on topics like advanced AEM techniques, Angular, OWASP threats, AWS/Azure, etc.
- Work in Agile, team-oriented environment. To that end, I developed a utility to interpolate Jira ticket links in daily scrum messages using raw HTML/CSS/JS, currently hosted at [https://www.coreyhgross.com/scrumlinkutility](https://www.coreyhgross.com/scrumlinkutility).
- To aid in our a11y (accessibility) efforts, I duplicated an existing color contrast tool so I could add query string parameter functionality. This allowed us to programmatically create links to comparisons of specific color combinations in our a11y Excel sheets. This is currently hosted at [https://www.coreyhgross.com/a11ycolortool](https://www.coreyhgross.com/a11ycolortool)
- Created a tool that took in selectors from Lighthouse audits and spat out regexes to search through our entire codebase in VSCode for occurrences to help find problem components.

## Fun Facts

- I was working on the stage crew for our high school's musical in 8th grade and a steel pole holding a stage curtain fell and grazed me on the ear. A few inches over and I would have been eating from a straw for the rest of my life, according to the doctor. I later played Reverend Shaw in Footloose and Professor Harold Hill in The Music Man on the same stage.
- My wife and I have a goldendoodle named August Adventure Gross-Lewin, CGC. "Adventure" is **literally** his middle name. The CGC stands for "Canine Good Citizen," an obedience certification he achieved through the American Kennel Club. He has his own Instagram account - [@augustadventuredog](https://www.instagram.com/augustadventuredog/). We're fully obnoxious about him. They recently [made the news](https://6abc.com/philly-proud-dentist-therapy-dog-service/13930815/) for his work in her dental practice.
- Prior to COVID, I could handle a handful of recipes; over the course of the pandemic, I made loads of recipes from The Food Lab and Bravetart and learned loads of additional cooking techniques. I can make some pretty great food now - sous vide steaks and cheeseburgers, homemade marshmallows, the best snickerdoodles I've ever eaten, and loads more. I'm currently working on doing more fully meatless meals.
