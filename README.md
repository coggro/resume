- To aid in our a11y (accessibility) efforts, I duplicated an existing color contrast tool so I could add query string parameter functionality. This allowed us to programmatically create links to comparisons of specific color combinations in our a11y Excel sheets. This is currently hosted at [https://www.coreyhgross.com/a11ycolortool](https://www.coreyhgross.com/a11ycolortool)
- Created a tool that took in selectors from Lighthouse audits and spat out regexes to search through our entire codebase in VSCode for occurrences to help find problem components.

## Fun Facts

- I was working on the stage crew for our high school's musical in 8th grade and a steel pole holding a stage curtain fell and grazed me on the ear. A few inches over and I would have been eating from a straw for the rest of my life, according to the doctor. I later played Reverend Shaw in Footloose and Professor Harold Hill in The Music Man on the same stage.
- My wife and I have a goldendoodle named August Adventure Gross-Lewin, CGC. "Adventure" is **literally** his middle name. The CGC stands for "Canine Good Citizen," an obedience certification he achieved through the American Kennel Club. He has his own Instagram account - [@augustadventuredog](https://www.instagram.com/augustadventuredog/). We're fully obnoxious about him. He makes an excellent office dog - _wink, wink_.
- Prior to COVID, I could handle a handful of recipes; over the course of the pandemic, I've been making loads of recipes from The Food Lab and Bravetart and learning loads of additional cooking techniques. I can make some pretty great food now - sous vide steaks and cheeseburgers, homemade marshmallows, the best snickerdoodles I've ever eaten, and more. I'm currently working on learning more ways to prepare vegetables and legumes.
