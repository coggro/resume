## Fun Facts

<hr class="gold" />

- I was working on the stage crew for our high school's musical in 8th grade when a steel pole holding a stage curtain fell and grazed me on the ear. A few inches over and I would have been eating from a straw for the rest of my life, according to the doctor. I later played Reverend Shaw in Footloose and Professor Harold Hill in The Music Man on the same stage.
- My wife and I have a goldendoodle named August Adventure Gross-Lewin, CGC. "Adventure" is **literally** his middle name. The CGC stands for "Canine Good Citizen," an obedience certification he achieved through the American Kennel Club. He has his own Instagram account - [@augustadventuredog](https://www.instagram.com/augustadventuredog/). We're fully obnoxious about him. He makes an excellent office dog - _wink, wink_.
- Prior to COVID, I could handle a handful of recipes; over the course of the pandemic, I've been making loads of recipes from The Food Lab and Bravetart and learning loads of additional cooking techniques. I can make some pretty great food now - sous vide cheeseburgers, homemade marshmallows, the best snickerdoodles I've ever eaten, and more. Next up is fresh, homemade bread.
